# MINIRT 42 project

My first RayTracer with miniLibX

## Description

MiniRT is a ray tracer project coded in C. The goal is to display shapes in a 3D rendering, using the 'miniLibX', the graphic lib from 42 school.

## Some of the constraints

- You need at least these 3 simple geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder.
- Your program must be able to resize the object’s unique properties: diameter for a sphere and the width and height for a cylinder.
- Your program must be able to apply translation and rotation transformation to objects, lights and cameras (except for spheres and lights that cannot be rotated).
- Light management: spot brightness, hard shadows, ambiance lighting (objects are never completely in the dark). You must implement Ambient and diffuse lighting.
- The program displays the image in a window and respect the following rules:
◦ Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
◦ Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and
quit the program cleanly.
